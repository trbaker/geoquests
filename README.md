GeoQuests marry a summative assessment, published by an educator in Google Forms or Survey123, with a cohort of maps and map applications - namely from across the ArcGIS platform.

GeoQuests provide the digital glue for presenting the content in a single, manageable browser window while ensuring all student assessment data is handled and routed entirely by the system the educator created it in.
